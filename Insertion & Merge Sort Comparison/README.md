## This program will use either Merge Sort or Insertion Sort (or both) to sort an randomized array.

### This program should essentially begin by prompting the user on how large they would like their array to be sorted to be.

It then prompts the user on what range they would like the values inside their array's to be randomized in.
i.e.: If they would like random numbers in the range from 0 - 100, it will create an array with randomly generated numbers between
0 and 100. This program can also handle negative values as well in case the user want's to try that.

After displaying the randomly generated array to the user, it will prompt the user again with a menu.
In this menu there will be 3 choices, sorting the array (and graphing it) with 1. Insertion Sort, 2. Merge Sort, or 3. Using both
sorts and graphing the time.

All these choices will sort the array, in their respected way's and if the array is small enough it will display the sorted 
array and the graph. 

If the array is larger than 100 elements it will only display the graph, this minimizes clutter in the program.

### Description of Images Included
There are 3 images, one with a graph of 25,000 elements sorted, one with 525 elements, and one with only 20 elements. As you can tell for 25,000 elements merge sort beats insertion sort for speed by a long shot. Around 525 elements they get very similar, and for 20 elements insertion sort is extremely fast.
